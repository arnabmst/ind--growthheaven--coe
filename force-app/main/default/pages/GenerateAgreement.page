Partnership to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section&nbsp;3.10, such Partnership will be entitled to recover the expenses upon a final adjudication from which no further right of appeal may be
taken. In any suit brought to enforce a right to indemnification or to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section&nbsp;3.10, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be

consults with legal counsel to such Partnership and counsel confirms that the Transfer will not cause such Partnership to be treated as a “publicly traded Partnership” taxable as a corporation, however, the General Partner may not consent
to a Transfer unless the following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the proposed Transfer is to be made on the effective date of an offer by such Partnership to repurchase Shares; and (ii)&nbsp;the Transfer is (A)&nbsp;one in which the tax basis of the
Shares in the hands of the transferee is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to its tax basis in the hands of the Transferring Limited Partner (e.g., certain Transfers to affiliates, gifts and contributions to family entities), (B)&nbsp;to
members of the Transferring Limited Partner’s immediate family (siblings, spouse, parents and children), or (C)&nbsp;a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement account. In addition, the General Partner may not

the General Partner may not consent to the Transfer. Any permitted transferee will be entitled to the allocations and distributions allocable to the Shares so acquired and to Transfer the Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but
will not be entitled to the other rights of a Limited Partner unless and until the transferee becomes a substituted Limited Partner. If a Limited Partner Transfers Shares with the approval of the General Partner, the General Partner will promptly
take all necessary actions so that each transferee or successor to whom or to which the Shares are Transferred is admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner. The admission of any transferee as a substituted Limited Partner will be effective
upon the execution and delivery by, or on behalf of, the substituted Limited Partner of this Agreement or an instrument that constitutes the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Limited Partner and transferee agrees to pay all expenses,
including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, incurred by the Partnership in connection with any Transfer. In connection with any request to Transfer Shares, the Partnership may require the Limited Partner requesting the Transfer to obtain,
at the Limited Partner’s expense, an opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner as to such matters as the General Partner may reasonably request. If a Limited Partner Transfers all of its Shares, it will not cease to be a Limited
